        <p>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Prospective authors are
          encouraged to prepare research papers not exceeding 10 pages in single
          line space, including all figures, tables, and references. Further,
          details on formatting will be updated once the journals are finalized.
          Only original papers that have not been published or submitted for
          publication elsewhere will be considered. The authors must clearly
          outline the research area, main results, and contributions in the
          research papers. Every submission must be accompanied by a plagiarism
          report, with a similarity index not exceeding 10%.
