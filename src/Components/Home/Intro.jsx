          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The International Conference
          on Applications of Artificial Intelligence in Secured Computing, and
          Data Science (ICAISCDS-2025) is a premier global event that serves as
          a platform to globally connect research scholars, academicians,
          scientists, industry professionals, and students to share insights,
          innovations, and recent advancements in the fields of Artificial
          Intelligence (AI), Secured Computing (SC) and Data Science (DS).{" "}

          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Artificial Intelligence
          plays a critical role in secured computing and data science by
          enhancing security measures and data analysis capabilities. In secured
          computing, AI is used for anomaly detection, intrusion detection, and
          strengthening encryption methods to safeguard systems against cyber
          threats. In data science, AI enables the processing and analysis of
          large datasets through advanced machine learning models, improving
          predictive analytics, automation, and decision-making. Furthermore, AI
          can help protect privacy by applying techniques like differential
          privacy to ensure data is handled securely while still enabling
          valuable insights. Together, AI ensures both the protection of data
          and the effective extraction of knowledge.
